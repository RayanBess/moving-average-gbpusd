- **Simple Moving Average (SMA):** Calculates the average of a selected period.
- **Exponential Moving Average (EMA):** Applies more weight to recent prices for a faster response to price changes.
- **Customizable Periods:** Allows users to specify the number of periods over which to calculate the moving average.
- **Visualization:** Plots the GBP/USD price data along with the moving averages for easy analysis.
